\section{Cryptographic Primitives}
In this section we define some fundamental cryptographic primitives which are parts of the blockchain technology. The definitions of correctness and security of these primitives are in most cases defined using the notion of \emph{negligible functions}. We therefore first provide the definition of a negligible function in Definition~.

\begin{definition}[Negligible function]
	\label{def:negligible_function}
	A function $f$ is \textsf{negligible} if for all $ c \in \mathbb{R}$ there exists $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(n) \leq \dfrac{1}{n^c}$ for all $ n \geq n_0$. 
\end{definition}

Note that in the following we may often refer to \emph{polynomial-probalistic-time (PPT)} adversary simply as ``adversary''.
